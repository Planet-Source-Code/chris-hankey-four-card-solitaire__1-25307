## Four Card Solitaire


</div>

### Description

This submission is a 4 card soltaire game that I've never seen a PC version of. The game hard to win so it's a little boring. I just wanted to do a card game.

This code uses Microsoft's Cards32.dll. I've included a copy of the cards32.dll if your system does not already have it.

Thanks to the following people:

Shaddy (from PlanetSourceCode) - for help with getting the API calls to work.

Sean Calvert (from PlanetSourceCode) - for his idea of using Windows API calls to keep track of the cards.

VB2TheMax - for the "shuffle" logic.

Let me know if you have any problems, comments or questions.
 
### More Info
 
Your PC may not have as copy of cards32.dll. If it does not then make sure to copy cards32.dll to the Windows/System directory.
